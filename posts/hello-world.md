Golly gosh, I remembered when I first built my website with nothing but pure HTML and CSS (with a little bit of client side JS as well). I also promised that a blog will be coming soon. Well, here we are, 2+ years later, I finally decided to fulfill that promise. It turns out to be a good excuse to learn ***that JavaScript framework that everyone has been using***. Now that I have a blog platfom, I don't need to rely on Twitter threads whenever I want to show some cool stuff I've been working on. *(oh by the way here's my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gedehari))*

Anyways, that's all for the introduction. Thank you for reading and have a nice day.
